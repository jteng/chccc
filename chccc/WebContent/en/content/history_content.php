Cherry Hill Chinese Christian Church (CHCCC) is a non-denominational, Bible believing Christian church. 
The English ministry is an integral part of the CHCCC, and consists of an active Youth Program and a full-scale 
Children's Program (nursery-high school) with English as the common language among the attendants . 
On a typical Sunday, about 40 youths and 70 children attend worship services and Sunday school classes, in addition to about 
30 younger children attending the nursery and toddlers' classes. We also have regular fellowship on Friday evening at 
the church. Despite the differences we may have, we all come to CHCCC with the same purpose that is to know and worship our Savior 
and Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

CHCCC originated from the Chinese Mission of our "mother" church - Cherry Hill Baptist Church (CHBC). 
In 2000, several Chinese families attending CHBC started a family fellowship and Bible study group. 
With rapid growth of this Chinese fellowship group, in October 2002, CHBC launched the Chinese Mission with a separate Sunday 
worship service in Mandarin. In May 2004, the Chinese Mission launched out as a fledgling independent church: Cherry Hill Chinese 
Christian Church. The two congregations worked together in the children and youth ministries until April 2008 when CHBC closed and 
CHCCC assumed stewardship of the church facilities.</p>
