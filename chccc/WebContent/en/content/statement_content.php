 Cherry Hill Chinese Christian Church (CHCCC) is 
 a non-denominational, Bible believing Christian church. The English ministry is an integral part of the CHCCC, 
 and consists of an active Youth Program and a full-scale Children's Program (nursery-high school) with 
 English as the common language among the attendants . On a typical Sunday, 
 about 40 youths and 70 children attend worship services and Sunday school classes, 
 in addition to about 30 younger children attending the nursery and toddlers' classes. 
 We also have regular fellowship on Friday evening at the church. Despite the differences we may have, 
 we all come to CHCCC with the same purpose that is to know and worship our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ.
