<li>Who We Are</li>
<p>The English ministry is a Christ centered, multi-cultural fellowship that provides a dynamic spiritual experience to individuals and families. 
Our main goal is to reach the community around us - and through missionary endeavors – reach out across the world. We want people to feel comfortable 
worshiping with us and carrying out God’s Great Commission.

<p>The English ministry is an integral part of the CHCCC, and consists of an active Youth Program and a full-scale Children's Program 
(nursery-high school) with English as the common language among the attendees. On a typical Sunday, about 70 youths and 60 children attend 
worship services and Sunday school classes, in addition to about 30 younger children attending the nursery and toddlers' classes. We also have 
regular fellowship on Friday evening at the church.
